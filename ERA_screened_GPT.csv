However, there are still knowledge gaps on the effects of conservation practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this area. In this study, a four-year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2018 to assess the effects of tillage and crop residue management practices on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Subsequently, crop yields, area-scaled and yield-scaled total non-carbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions were assessed. Our research found that no till (NT) decreased N2O emissions by 22.6% compared with conventional tillage (CT) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seasons, but there was no difference between tillage practices in summer maize (Zea mays L.) seasons. Crop residue retention practice (+R) increased N2O emissions by 28.1% and 26.7% compared with residue removal practice (-R) in winter wheat and summer maize seasons, respectively. The NT soils took up more CH4 compared with the CT soils in summer maize seasons. Area-scaled total non-CO2 GHG emissions showed trends similar to those of N2O emission. Since crop residue retention improved the maize yield compared with the residue removal treatments, yield scaled total non-CO2 GHGs emission did not differ between residue management practices in summer maize seasons. Our four-year field measurements indicated that no-till practice could be more useful as an option to mitigate non-CO2 GHG emissions in the wheat - maize cropping system.","2022","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","crop residue management, reduced tillage","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

The main soil C-CO2 sources at the soil-plant interface are the decomposition of crop residues, SOM turnover, and respiration of roots and soil biota. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impacts of tillage and cropping systems on long-term soil C-CO2 emissions and their relationship with carbon (C) mineralization of crop residues. A long-term experiment was conducted in a Red Oxisol in Cruz Alta, RS, Brazil, with subtropical climate Cfa (Koppen classification), mean annual precipitation of 1,774 mm and mean annual temperature of 19.2 degrees C. Treatments consisted of two tillage systems: (a) conventional tillage (CT) and (b) no tillage (NT) in combination with three cropping systems: (a) R0- monoculture system (soybean/wheat), (b) R1- winter crop rotation (soybean/wheat/soybean/black oat), and (c) R2- intensive crop rotation (soybean/black oat/soybean/black oat + common vetch/maize/oilseed radish/wheat). The soil C-CO2 efflux was measured every 14 days for two years (48 measurements), by trapping the CO2 in an alkaline solution. The soil gravimetric moisture in the 0-0.05 m layer was determined concomitantly with the C-CO2 efflux measurements. The crop residue C mineralization was evaluated with the mesh-bag method, with sampling 14, 28, 56, 84, 112, and 140 days after the beginning of the evaluation period for C measurements. Four C conservation indexes were used to assess the relation between C-CO2 efflux and soil C stock and its compartments. The crop residue C mineralization fit an exponential model in time. For black oat, wheat and maize residues, C mineralization was higher in CT than NT, while for soybean it was similar. Soil moisture was higher in NT than CT, mainly in the second year of evaluation. There was no difference in tillage systems for annual average C-CO2 emissions, but in some individual evaluations, differences between tillage systems were noticed for C-CO2 evolution. Soil C-CO2 effluxes followed a hi-modal pattern, with peaks in October/November and February/March. The highest emission was recorded in the summer and the lowest in the winter. The C-CO2 effluxes were weakly correlated to air temperature and not correlated to soil moisture. Based on the soil C conservation indexes investigated, NT associated to intensive crop rotation was more C conserving than CT with monoculture.","2011","REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO","Brazil","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","no tillage, conventional tillage, crop rotation, monoculture system","Extracted","Yes","Excluded - Issues: target_crop_livestock"

However, its effect at high altitude remains unknown. We studied the effect of ridge-furrow with plastic-mulching practices on crop yields in semiarid farmland at high altitude (2400 m) from 2010 to 2011. The three treatments were as follows: (i) flat plot with no mulching (CK); (ii) alternating ridges (60-cm wide, 15-cm high) and furrows (60-cm wide) without plastic film (RF); and (iii) alternating ridges (60-cm wide, 15-cm high) and furrows (60-cm wide), with the ridges mulched with plastic film (RFM). Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) crops were planted in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The RFM treatment did not increase potato yields, but significantly increased the ratio of large tuber to total tuber yields (RBT). The RBTs for CK, RF, and RFM were 44.0, 46.8, and 66.7%, respectively. In 2011, the RFM treatment had significantly higher maize yield than the CK and RF treatments, and maize yield was mainly affected by temperature in May. In conclusion, ridge-furrowing with plastic film did not increase the total yield of potato crops compared with non-mulching treatments, but did increase large tuber yield. The increase in soil temperature in May caused by mulching was important for improving maize yield in semiarid farmland at high altitude.","2015","AGRONOMY JOURNAL","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","mulch","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Green-grain yield","REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA","10.5935/1806-6690.20200014",NA,"Green ears of maize are much appreciated all over Brazil and reach higher prices than dry grain. This also occurs with green cowpea grain, which is much appreciated in the north and northeast of the country. The aim of this study was to identify maize and cowpea cultivars that can be grown as monocrops or intercrops to produce green grain in the state of Para (PA). An experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with six replications in Maraba, PA. Monocrops of traditional varieties of the cowpea ('Corujinha' and `Sempre Verde') and the maize cultivars ('AG 1051' and `AL Bandeirante'), and four alternating, intercropped rows of a combination of the varieties and cultivars were evaluated. The `AG 1051' cultivar was more productive than the `AL Bandeirante' cultivar, as both a monocrop and an intercrop. The cowpea cultivars showed a similar performance under both systems of cultivation. There was no interaction between the maize cultivars and cowpea cultivars. The monocrops were superior to the intercrops for green-ear, green-pod and green-grain yield. Considering the land equivalent ratio, if the aim is to produce green pods, intercropping is only beneficial in the AG 1051 + Corujnha combination. If the aim is for green-grain yield in the cowpea, intercropping is more advantageous when the `AG 1051' cultivar is combined with any cowpea cultivar. The intercrop including the `AL Bandeirante' cultivar is only beneficial with the `Corujinha' cultivar, and if the aim is to market unhusked, green ears of maize.","2020","REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA","Brazil","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping","Rejected-after extracted","Yes","Included"

Food, energy, water and land resources in agroforestry systems are inextricably intertwined and expected to be severely impacted by climate change. Socioeconomic development and increasing populations have posed unique challenges for meeting the demand for food, energy, water and land, and the challenge will become more pressing under projected resource shortages and eco-environmental deterioration. Thus, a method of optimizing and sustainably managing the water-land-food-energy nexus in agroforestry systems under climate change must be developed. OBJECTIVE: This paper develops an optimization model framework for the sustainable management of limited water-land-food-energy resources in agroforestry systems under climate change. The aims are to (1) quantify the interactions and feedbacks within water, land, food and energy subsystems; (2) provide trade-offs among water and energy utilization efficiency, economic benefits and environmental protection in agroforestry systems; and (3) generate optimal policy options among water and land resources for different crops and woodlands in different regions under different climate change patterns. METHODS: The model framework is based on multiobjective fractional programming, and compromise programming is used to solve it. Climate change patterns are obtained from atmospheric circulation models and representative concentration pathways. The above aims are investigated through an actual nexus management problem in northeast China. Spatiotemporal meteorological and report-based databases, life cycle assessments, Pearson correlation analyses, data envelopment analyses and analytic hierarchy processes are integrated to realize practical application. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that climate variation will change the water and land allocation patterns and these changes will be more pronounced for major grain-producing areas. The optimized water allocation decreased (especially for rice, e.g., the optimal average value of the irrigation quota of rice was 4226 m(3)/ha, while the corresponding actual irrigation requirement of rice was [4200-7200] m(3)/ha) to improve the water use efficiency, and surface water allocation accounted for two-thirds. Maize had the largest planting area, although planting soybean generated the most greenhouse gases (greenhouse gas emissions from field activities for rice, maize, and soybean were 43.46%, 84.06% and 91.16%, respectively); However, these gases can be absorbed by forests. The model improved the harmonious degree of the resource-economy-environment system from 0.24 to 0.56 after optimization. SIGNIFICANCES: Integrated models contribute to the sustainable management of water, food, energy and land resources and can consider the complex dynamics under climate change. It can be used as a general model and extended to other agroforestry systems that show inefficient agricultural production.","2021","AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS","China","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","agroforestry","Rejected-Full Text Screening","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, field_study, primary_data, study_type"

Five treatments, with the soil matric potential (SMP) threshold range of -10 to -50 kPa at intervals of 10 kPa, were applied in this study and are correspondingly referred to as T1 to T5. Leaf area index, plant height, soil water content, yield, and total soluble solids (TSS) were measured, and seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ET), water productivity (WP), and irrigation water productivity (IWP) were computed regularly. Results showed that the differences in leaf area index, plant height, above-ground biomass, and crop yield in treatments T1 though T4 were similar (P>0.05), but higher (P<0.05) than those of treatment T5. Irrigation amount and crop ET generally decreased with decreasing SMP threshold. Threshold values with SMPs from -10 kPa to -30 kPa caused a reduction of irrigation amount by 22-43% and crop ET reduction by 11-25%. Higher TSS, larger percentage of marketable fruits, and higher WP and IWP were found for treatments T3 and T4 in both growing seasons. The highest SMP threshold (-10 kPa) and lowest SMP threshold (-50 kPa) greatly reduced the WP and IWP. Therefore, a SMP threshold range of -30 kPa to -40 kPa at 20 cm depth was recommended for irrigation management of chili pepper under mulched-drip irrigation conditions in the arid region of Northwest China.

Agroforestry trees offer many ecological and socioeconomic benefits, such as added income, food, and medicine. They are currently under threat in this region due to recent changes in agricultural and land use practices. For example, a reduction in traditional fallow rotation periods has led to decreased regeneration of a common agroforestry tree, shea (Vitellaria paradoxa), which has been an important economic resource for women. The aims of this study were to determine beneficial spatial distributions of shea to maintain high yields of staple crops and to better understand male and female farmer perceptions of shea maintenance. We compared maize (Zea mays) vegetative growth, grain yield, soil moisture, and light availability associated with individual shea trees and clumps of trees on five farms in Ghanaian agroforestry parklands. We also interviewed local farmers to better understand their management perspectives. Maize vegetative growth increased with light availability, but was not limited by soil moisture. Conversely and contrary to farmer perceptions, grain yield was not influenced by light availability, but increased with increasing soil moisture. Also contrary to common beliefs of local farmers, grain yield was greater under clumps of shea compared to scattered distributions of individual trees. We therefore recommend the maintenance of clumped distributions of shea, as they provide beneficial microclimates for staple crops, and could assist in improving the productivity of shea products that are considered the domain of women farmers.","2019","AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS","Ghana","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","agroforestry","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

The productivity of sole or intercropped crops is subject to variety, location, year, and their interaction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the productivity of newly released common bean varieties NUA45 and SER83 under sole cropping and intercropping with a maize hybrid variety SC672 as a guide to large-scale production. Experiments were conducted at Chitedze Agricultural Research Station (13.85 degrees S; 33.38 degrees E) and Linthipe Extension Planning Area (12.06 degrees S; 33.25 degrees E) in 2019 and 2020 in Malawi using a factorial arrangement laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. The numbers of pods per plant (NPP) and seeds per pod (NSP), grain yield (GYD), and 100-seed weight were collected for common bean included, while GYD was recorded for maize. The main effects for genotype, location, year, and intercropping system were significant (p < 0.05) for GYD in common bean. The effects of the year and cropping system and location by intercropping system interaction were significant for maize GYD. The maize yield did not vary between sole cropped and intercropped systems. The total land equivalent ratios (LERs) for NUA45 and SER83 were 1.59 and 1.77, respectively. The LER-values showed a significant difference (p < 0.034), suggesting a considerably higher benefit of maize and common bean intercropping. Overall, intercropping maize with common bean rendered higher yields in the SER83/SC672 intercropping system than the sole crop in the study areas. Therefore, intra-row intercropping of the newly released common bean variety SER83 with a maize hybrid variety SC672 is recommended in the study area and other similar agro-ecologies for stable and sustainable production of both crops.","2021","FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS","Malawi","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Studies were conducted to evaluate the productivity, weed dynamics, nutrient mining, and monetary advantages in the maize-legume intertropping systems. The highest yield, maize equivalent yield (MEY), and per day productivity were recorded in the plot of sole cowpea (CP) and plots of maize (M) intercropped with CP at row proportions of 1:2 (1M:2CP) and 1M:5CP. Density and biomass of grasses, sedges, and broadleaved weeds were lowest in the plot of sole CP followed by 1M:5CP. Weed smothering efficiency was highest (88%) in the plot of sole CP followed by 1M:5CP, and lowest in the plot of 1M: 1frenchbean(FB) (8%). Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were removed less by weeds by intercropping M with CP than with any other legume at row proportions of 1:5. Uptake of nitrogen and potassium was high in the plot of 1M: 5 blackgram (BG) The net return, net return per dollar of investment, and marginal returns were high in the plot of 1M:2CP followed by 1M:5CP. Intercropping M with CP at a row proportion of 1:2 gave a higher yield and nutrient uptake, and lowered nutrient mining by weeds with higher returns. In an area where weeds are the major competitor with M for site-specific resources, intercropping M with CP at a row proportion of 1:2 or 1:5 will help to suppress weeds and also to obtain higher MEY. Higher yield gave better returns. Inclusion of legumes increased the uptake of nutrients by maize. This intercropping system may be found efficient in similar situations or land use elsewhere, especially in Southeast Asia.","2014","PLANT PRODUCTION SCIENCE","India, Southeast Asia","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping, crop residue management","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

This has exaggerated the need for sustainable alternatives. Here, the impact of four tillage cum crop establishment practices [conventional puddled transplanted rice followed by conventional till maize/wheat (CTTPR-CT), non-puddled transplanted rice followed by zero-till maize/wheat (NPTPR-ZT), zero-till transplanted rice followed by zero-till maize/wheat (ZTTPR-ZT), zero-till direct seeded rice followed by zero-till maize/wheat (ZTDSR-ZT)], two residue management [residue removal, residue retention (similar to 33.0%)] and two rice-based rotations (rice-wheat, rice-maize) on crop performance, system productivity, and production economics were evaluated. At 4th and 5th year of rotation, complete zero-tillage-based crop establishment (ZTDSR-ZT, ZTTPR-ZT) enhanced the grain yield of rice (9.3-20.6%), wheat (18.4-22.6%), and maize (10.8-11.8%) over CTTPR-CT, whereas yield advantage in NPTPR-ZT was marginal for all the crops. The higher grain yield of rice and wheat in ZTDSR-ZT and ZTTPR-ZT treatments was mainly attributed to higher tiller production (rice 11.5-23.2%; wheat 29.5-34.9%). Likewise, the higher aboveground biomass, cob length, cob weight, and grains weight cob(-1) led to higher maize yield in conservation tillage treatments (NPTPR-ZT, ZTDSR-ZT, and ZTTPR-ZT). Retention of crop residue improved (p < 0.05) the yield of all crops being higher in maize (6.9-10.3%) followed by wheat (5.3-10.5%). The reduced cost of cultivation and higher return from produce in ZTDSR-ZT, ZTTPR-ZT, and NPTPR-ZT enhanced the net income by INR 48164, 35800, 25632, respectively, over CTTPR-CT.

This study explored both the impact of long-term rainfall variability and the long-term effects of various combinations of maize stover, cattle manure and mineral fertiliser (NP) applications on maize (Zea mays L) yields and water use efficiency (WUE) under reduced tillage practices, at Shouyang Dryland Farming Experimental Station in northern China from 1993 onwards. The experiment was set up according to an incomplete, optimal design, with 3 factors at five levels and 12 treatments including a control with two replications. Grain yields were greatly influenced by the amount of rain during the growing season, and by soil water at sowing. Annual mean grain yields ranged from 3 to 10 t ha(-1) and treatment mean yields from 4.2 to 7.2 t ha(-1). The WUE ranged from 40 in treatments with balanced nutrient inputs in dry (weather/or soil) years to 6.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for the control treatments in wet years. The WUE averaged over the 15-year period ranged from 11 to 19 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Balanced combination of stover (3000-6000 kg), manure (1500-6000 kg) and N fertiliser (105 kg) gave the highest yield and hence WUE. It is suggested that 100 kg N per ha should be a best choice, to be adapted according to availability of stover and manure. Possible management options under variable rainfall conditions to alleviate occurring moisture stress for crops must be tailored to the rainfall pattern. The potentials of split applications, targeted to the need of the growing crop (response nutrient management), should be explored to further improve grain yield and WUE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate grain yield and yield components of three vetch species and finger millet intercropped at different seeding ratios. Factorial combination of three vetch species and five seeding ratios (0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 100 : 0% finger millet: vetch) were laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Analysis of variance showed that intercropping had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on plant height, heads per plant, fingers per head, and grain yield of finger millet. The highest grain yield (2058.75 kg ha(-1)) of finger millet was harvested from a treatment combination of 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa. Analysis of variance also showed that plant height, leaves per plant, branches per plant, pods per plant, seeds per pod, and seed yield of vetch species had significantly varied (P < 0.05) for the tested treatments. Maximum and minimum seed yields (236.19 and 106.45 kg ha(-1)) of vetch were harvested from 25% finger millet + 75% Vicia sativa and 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa, respectively. LER and RCC were improved due to intercropping different species of vetch with finger millet at various seeding ratios. The highest total LER (1.146) and RCC (3.00) were obtained from 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa. Thus, it can be concluded that in Bako and similar agroecologies, where feed shortage is a critical problem, intercropping of 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa can be used to alleviate the existing feed shortage in smallholder farming system.","2022","ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE","NA","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","intercropping","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, target_crop_livestock"

This study examined whether RF systems with black plastic film perform better than white film in rainfed areas with adequate accumulated temperature. In 2016 and 2017, a field experiment was conducted in the Loess Plateau of China that involved sowing maize under three farming systems: conventional flat planting (CK), ridge-furrow (RF) system with white plastic (WP), and RF with black plastic (BP). The growth period for maize under BP was 5 days longer than under WP and 5 days shorter than CK in two years. The BP treatment produced a significantly higher leaf area index in maize than the CK and WP treatments at 100 and 120 days after sowing (DAS) in two years. Topsoil temperatures in the BP treatment were significantly lower than WP at 20, 80 and 100 DAS in two years. The BP treatment had better soil water content and soil water storage than WP during growth in two years.

However, little is known about the CF of winter wheat and spring maize production under different tillage practices in the Loess Plateau of China. To quantify the tillage differences and crop type differences in CF, a field experiment was established in 2007 in which the following six tillage practices were evaluated: plow tillage (PT), no-tillage (NT), subsoil tillage (ST), PT/NT rotation, NT/ST rotation and ST/PT rotation. The results showed PT had the positive CF value (488 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)), indicating a carbon source. However, NT, ST, ST/PT, PT/NT and NT/ST significantly decreased the CF (-628, -1382, -2328, -3038 and -3545 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)), demonstrating these tillage practices served as carbon sinks. The functional unit-scaled CFs (yield-scaled CF, cost-scaled CF, production value-scaled CF and net income-scaled CF) were similar to the trend of CF, which exhibited the following order: NT/ST > PT/NT > ST/PT > ST > NT > PT. The CF and functional unit-scaled CFs of winter wheat production were significantly higher than those of spring maize production. The CF and functional unit-scaled CFs decreased as planting year increased. In addition, increasing SOC storage and grain yield were benefit for decreasing CF. The results of this study showed NT/ST rotation produced the highest grain yield and SOC storage with the lowest CF and functional unit-scaled CFs and was thus determined to be the best tillage practice for balancing sustainable production with the environment in the Loess Plateau.

CA here refers to minimum soil disturbance (no-till), year-round organic mulch cover, and diverse cropping in the rotation. A total of 28 farmers (13 farmers in Ethiopia and 15 farmers in Ghana) participated in this experiment. The experimental setup was a paired `t' design on a 100 m(2) plot; where half of the plot was assigned to CA and the other half to conventional tillage (CT), both under drip irrigation system. Irrigation water use and crop yield were monitored for three seasons in Ethiopia and one season in Ghana for vegetable production including garlic, onion, cabbage, tomato, and sweet potato. Irrigation water use was substantially lower under CA, 18% to 45.6%, with a substantial increase in crop yields, 9% to about two-fold, when compared with CT practice for the various vegetables. Crop yields and irrigation water uses were combined into one metric, water productivity, for the statistical analysis on the effect of CA with drip irrigation system. One-tailed paired `t' test statistical analysis was used to examine if the mean water productivity in CA is higher than that of CT. Water productivity was found to be significantly improved (alpha = 0.05) under the CA practice; 100%, 120%, 222%, 33%, and 49% for garlic, onion, tomato, cabbage, and sweet potato respectively. This could be due to the improvement of soil quality and structure due to CA practice, adding nutrients to the soil and sticking soil particles together (increase soil aggregates). Irrigation water productivity for tomato under CA (5.17 kg m(-3) in CA as compared to 1.61 kg m(-3) in CT) is found to be highest when compared to water productivity for the other vegetables. The mulch cover provided protection for the tomatoes from direct contact with the soil and minimized the chances of soil-borne diseases. Adapting to CA practices with drip irrigation in vegetable home gardens is, therefore, a feasible strategy to improve water use efficiency, and to intensify crop yield, which directly contributes towards the sustainability of livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the region.","2019","WATER","Ethiopia, Ghana","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No",NA,"Rejected-Full Text Screening","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, target_crop_livestock"

However, it is unclear whether near-surface stratification of soil P eases or hampers P uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) which needs an optimum P supply at/before six-leaf-stage to achieve potential grain yield. The aim of the three-year study was to determine whether P stratification, under zero tillage, impaired yield of maize and which P placement methods could improve P uptake on an Aeric Albaquept soil subgroup. Phosphorus fertilizer was placed by: (a) broadcasting before final tillage and sowing of seeds; (b) surface banding beside the row; and (c) deep banding beside the row (both the band placements were done at three-four leaf stage) Phosphorus treatments were repeated for 3 years along with three tillage practices viz.: (a) zero tillage (ZT); (b) conventional tillage (12 cm; CT); and (c) deep tillage (25 cm; DT). In the third year, all the tillage practices gave similar yield of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) hybrid maize-5, but the highest grain yield was obtained by surface band P placement. After three years of tillage and P placements, the root mass density (RMD) at 0-6 cm depth increased significantly from 1.40 mg cm(-3) in DT under deep band placement to 1.98 mg cm(-3) in ZT under surface band placement, but not at the other depths. The combination of ZT practices, with broadcast or surface band placement methods, produced the highest available, and total P, content in soil at 0-6 cm depth after harvesting of maize. Accordingly, a significant increase in P uptake by maize was also found with surface banding of P alone and also in combination with ZT. Organic carbon, and total N, also increased significantly at depths of 0-6 cm after three years in ZT treatments with P placed in bands. By contrast, CT and DT practices, under all placement methods, resulted in an even distribution of P up to 24 cm depth. Phosphorus application, by surface banding at the three-four leaf stage, led to increased P uptake at early growth and silking stages, which resulted in highest yield regardless of tillage type through increased extractable P in the soil. Even though ZT increased P stratification near the soil surface, and it increased plant available water content (PAWC) and RMD in the 0-6 cm depth, as did surface banding, it did not improve maize grain yield.

A stratified sampling of wheat heads according to morphological differences was followed by estimates of field size and grain yield and a formal interview with the landowner about the cropping sequence and the inputs used. About 75% of the cereal fields were cropped in rotation systems with faba bean (Vicia faba L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.) or fallow.

The morphological characterization of the collection revealed 19 taxonomically different varieties of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) but also barley and triticale (Triticosecale Wittm.) grown in mixtures. Populations within one field consisted of up to seven botanical wheat varieties. Farmers did not differentiate between morphological differences within such mixtures but identified their populations instead according to grain color, cooking properties and resistance to mildew and frost.

The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the magnitude of nutrient loss through soil erosion under different cropping systems and amendments to inform agronomic practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A field experiment was carried out on runoff plots with different cropping systems (sole maize, sole cowpea, sole maize and maize intercropped with soybean) as main plots and soil amendments (biochar, NPK (Nitrogen +Phosphorus +Potassium) fertilizer, NPK + biochar and a control (no amendment)) constituting the subplots in a randomized complete block design. For each block, a bare plot was included to assess the efficiency of the different crop and soil management practices on soil erosion. The study was carried out in three consecutive cropping seasons in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana.

The positive effects of soil mulching on crop yields and CWP have been studied through numerous field experiments and simulations at the site scale. However, few studies have focused on assessing mulching effects at the regional scale. The Zhangye Basin, a typical arid region in the middle Heihe River Basin of northwest China, was chosen as the focus of the present study. The AquaCrop model, a water-driven crop growth model, was first calibrated and validated using field observations from three experimental stations and extended to the regional scale by considering the spatial heterogeneity of soil, meteorology, crop characteristics, irrigation treatment and land use change. Three mulching practices under current irrigation schedules were simulated in the well-validated model for a 20-year period (1995-2015). The results showed that plastic film mulching conserved soil water and significantly reduced nonproductive evaporation. Crop transpiration and yield were enhanced while evapotranspiration decreased under mulching. Compared to no mulching, half-film mulching and major film mulching with 70% coverage effectively improved CWPs at the regional scale, with respective average increases of 7.2% +/- 0.9% and 14.1% +/- 2.2% for seed maize and 4.1% +/- 0.7% and 7.8% +/- 1.0% for spring wheat. The results demonstrated that the impacts of plastic film mulching on CWP varied with crop type and location in relation to water input. The regional evaluation also identified one particular area (Ganzhou) as the most suitable to apply plastic films, especially to seed maize.

The study was carried out in agroforestry and full-sun coffee systems on three family farms in Minas Gerais, the Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil during three consective days on each farm. Twenty 1-m(2) sampling areas (10 for each system), each separated by a distance of 5 x 5 m and located between coffee plant rows, were selected on each farm. Soil physical and chemical attributes, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, the percentage of canopy cover, and soil CO2 efflux were measured at each sampling area in the two systems. The air and soil temperature in the agroforestry systems were lower and soil moisture was higher than in the full-sun systems. Soil CO2 efflux showed different dynamics in the two systems. Daytime soil CO2 efflux was more stable (i.e. from morning to midday) in the agroforestry system (average 15% increase) compared to the full-sun system (average 49.1% increase). Soil CO2 efflux was regulated by labile carbon and total nitrogen variation in the agroforestry systems, and by soil temperature variation at a depth of 10 cm in the full-sun systems. A principal components analysis with data from all grouped systems showed that soil CO2 efflux was generally positively correlated with soil temperature at 5 and 10 cm depths, and negatively correlated with soil moisture. In conclusion, agroforestry systems promote microclimate stability and decrease soil CO2 efflux variability compared to full-sun systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AFSs can sequester carbon and amend the organic matter, thereby enhancing the crop productivity. Carbon sequestration depends on the type of AFSs, climate, cropping pattern, and management practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate different AFSs for their potential to sequester carbon and impact on soil organic matter (SOM) in the eastern sub-Himalayas, India. Hedge-, alder-, and guava-based AFSs were established along with control (without any tree), and the maize-mustard-potato cropping pattern was followed in each AFS. Soil samples were collected after the fifth crop cycle and further analyzed. The results showed that crop productivity was significantly higher in all the AFSs than control. On average, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly higher by 62 and 64% in hedge-based AFSs as compared to guava-based AFSs and control, respectively, and at par with alder-based AFSs. Particulate organic carbon (POC) was higher in all the three AFSs than in the control. For microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, the trend of AFSs was expressed as alder-based AFS > hedge-based AFS > guava-based AFS > control. Hedge- and alder-based AFSs had higher SOC stocks than guava-based AFSs and control. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) emissions were greater in control than hedge-based AFSs (35.2 Mg ha(-1)), followed by alder-based AFSs (28.6 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest was observed in guava-based AFSs. On an average, hedge species accumulated more nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which were 60, 12, and 28 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. This conclusively proved that AFSs were significantly affecting SOM pools and crop productivity and had a significant role in carbon retention in the soil. Overall, hedge- and alder-based AFSs retained higher soil carbon, and hence, hedge- and alder-based AFSs may be promoted to achieve climate-smart agriculture practices in the acid soils of the Indian sub-Himalayan region.","2022","FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE","India","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","agroforestry","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Grain filling is a significant stage in maize yield formation. Solar radiation is the energy source for grain filling, which is the ultimate driving factor for final grain weight and grain filling capacity that determine maize yield. Here, we first confirmed the quantitative relationships between grain filling parameters and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by conducting field experiments using different shading and plant density conditions and cultivars in 2019 and 2020 in Xinjiang, China. The results showed that with every 100 MJ m(-2) increase in PAR, the average grain filling rate (G(ave)), maximum grain-filling rate (G(max)), and the kernel weight at the time of maximum grain-filling rate (W-max) increased by 0.073 mg kernel(-1) day(-1), 0.23 mg kernel(-1) day(-1), and 0.24 mg kernel(-1), and the time of maximum grain-filling rate (T-max) delayed by 0.91 day. Relative changes in PAR were significantly and positively correlated with relative changes in yield and G(ave). With every 1% change in PAR, yield and G(ave) changed by 1.16 and 0.17%, respectively. From the perspective of grain filling capacity, DH618 was a more shade-resistant cultivar than XY335 and ZD958.

We interviewed 644 farmers across Rwanda, both users and non-users of plant clinics. Propensity score matching was used to match the users and non-users of plant clinics and logistic regression was used to assess a number of factors, including interactions with plant clinics, that affect farmers' adoption of pest management practices. Our analysis shows that users of plant clinics are more aware and knowledgeable in recognizing and handling maize stem borers. Furthermore, users of plant clinics have on average higher yields than non-users and this difference is highly significant (P<0.001).

Results showed that, reduction in bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (SPR) and enhancement of water holding capacity and infiltration were associated with CA based scenarios (Sc3-Sc6). Scenario 3 recorded lowest BD of 1.39 and 1.58 g cm(-3) at 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil depth, respectively. CA based Sc6 recorded highest infiltration rate (1.48 cm hr(-1)) and lowest was associated with Sc1 (0.5 cm hr(-1)).

Conservation agriculture is based on three principles: soil tillage that is limited to the sowing row, crop rotation, and soil surface cover throughout the year (>30%). Despite these principles, the maintenance of soil cover throughout the year and crop rotation are commonly neglected, which can promote changes in soil aggregation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fallow in the off-season, and two crop successions (grass/grass and grass/legume), on soil aggregation in NT systems. The study was conducted in five fields with different land uses for more than 10 years in southeastern Brazil. Three land uses under NT, all sown with maize within the season, were used, yielding three groups: NT with fallow in the off-season (NT-f), NT with legumes (brown hemp) in the off-season (NT-l), and NT with maize in the off-season (NT-g). For comparison, we considered forest land (F) as a conservation reference for soil aggregation and land being used under conventional tillage (CT) as a low conservation system. The soil variable that contributed the most to the separation of land use was the mineral associated organic carbon content. The absence of soil surface cover throughout the year in an NT system is as harmful to soil aggregation as a CT system. Moreover, succession promotes differences in soil aggregation, with grass-grass succession (NT-g) leading to higher particulate organic carbon content and aggregate stability index in some soil layers compared to the NT-l. Here, we demonstrate that conservation agriculture practices, such as NT, require a system-centered approach to improve soil conditions. We also found that fallow in the off-season promotes an NT system with low soil conservation.","2022","GEODERMA","Brazil","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","crop rotation, reduced tillage, soil surface cover","Rejected-Full Text Screening","Yes","Excluded - Issues: target_crop_livestock"

Growing maize during this season, with sowing from January through April, imposes several climatic risks that can impact crop yield. This is mainly caused by the high variability of precipitation and the probability of frost during the reproduction phases. High production risks are also partially due to the use of cultivars that are not adapted to the local environmental conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate crop growth and development and associated yield, yield components and water use efficiency (WUE) for maize hybrids with different maturity ratings grown off-season in a subtropical environment under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Three experiments were conducted in 2001 and 2002 in Piracicaba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil with four hybrids of different maturity duration, AG9010 (very short season), DAS CO32 and Exceler (short season) and DKB 333B (normal season). Leaf area index (LAI), plant height and dry matter were measured approximately every 18 days. Under rainfed conditions, the soil water content in the deeper layers was reduced, suggesting that the extension of the roots into these layers was a response to soil water limitations. On average, WUE varied from 1.45 kg m(-3) under rainfed conditions to 1.69 kg m(-3) under irrigated conditions during 2001. The average yield varied from 4209 kg hat for the hybrids grown under rainfed conditions to 5594 kg ha(-1) under irrigated conditions during 2001. Yield reductions under rainfed conditions were affected by the genotype. For the hybrid DKB 333B with a normal maturity, yield was reduced by 25.6% while the short maturity hybrid Exceler was the least impacted by soil water limitations with a yield reduction of only 8.4%. To decrease the risk of yield loss, the application of supplemental irrigation should be considered by local farmers, provided that this practice is not restricted by either economic considerations or the availability of sufficient water resources.","2007","JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE","NA","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","reduced tillage, supplemental irrigation","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Smallholder farmers who recently adopted relay cropping of lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) observed a decline in bean yields where lablab residues had been incorporated prior to maize and bean planting. We investigated chafer grub (Schizonycha spp.) damage to beans and studied the impact of lablab and maize stover residue management strategy, planting time, and bean cultivar selection on seedling damage. Seedling assays (germination to flower initiation), involving four different bean varieties (GLP2, KK15, KK22, and KTL3), were carried out in three consecutive planting periods. The assays were superimposed on a long-term, factorial experiment where soils had been subjected to differential lablab and maize stover residue management strategies for 7 years. Factors were (1) lablab residues removed (L0) or retained (L1); (2) maize stover removed (S0) or retained (S1) and (3) residues left on the soil surface (I0) or incorporated (I1). Planting time significantly affected the degree of chafer grub damage, with later planted beans sustaining substantially more damage. Of the four bean varieties, KK15 and GLP2 were more grub tolerant than KK22 and KTL3. Grub damage was most severe in plots where lablab residues had been retained and maize stovers had been removed (L1S0). This factor combination had the highest seedling mortality, the poorest stand establishment, and the largest proportion of plants with severed roots systems. The results of this study show that the current farmer practice (lablab residue retention and maize stover removal) is conducive to increased grub-induced bean seedling damage and suggest that early planting, retention of maize stover, and selection of grub-tolerant varieties are important management strategies to reduce damage and subsequent productivity decline.

A 2-year survey of small-scale maize farmers covering the 2004 and 2005 maize production seasons was carried out in the area to compare yields and production efficiency (i.e. the capacity to obtained maximum yields with least cost input combination between farmers) who applied chemical pesticides and those who did not, thus knowingly or unknowingly relying on BC. The role of pest and parasitoid, habitat management techniques and soil fertility measures in influencing maize production was also investigated. The results revealed that average yields and technical efficiency of maize producers ranged from 1 to 1.2 ton/ha and 57.9-67.9%, respectively. Farmers could improve maize yields by up to 42% by improving production efficiency and optimal allocation of labor and use of inorganic fertilizers. Because of low average maize yields, the return to pest control was low. Farmers that had natural grassy habitats in the vicinity of maize fields, applied fertilizers or used chemical pesticides to control stemborers obtained equivalent yields.

However, the effects of different levels of BC and N application in these systems remain unclear. To address this gap, the study is intended to ascertain the impact of various combinations of BC and N fertilizer on the performance of maize-soybean intercropping and determine the optimum application of BC and N for maximizing the effect of the intercropping system. MethodsA two-year (2021-2022) field experiment was conducted in Northeast China to assess the impact of BC (0, 15, and 30 t ha(-1)) and N application (135, 180, and 225 kg ha(-1)) on plant growth, yield, water use efficiency (WUE), N recovery efficiency (NRE) and quality in an intercropping system. Maize and soybean were selected as materials in the experiment, where every 2 rows of maize were intercropped with 2 rows of soybean. Results and discussionThe results showed that the combination of BC and N significantly affected the yield, WUE, NRE and quality of intercropped maize and soybean. The treatment of 15 t ha(-1) BC and 180 kg ha(-1) N increased grain yield and WUE, while that of 15 t ha(-1) BC and 135 kg ha(-1) N enhanced NRE in both years. Nitrogen promoted the protein and oil content of intercropped maize, but decreased the protein and oil content of intercropped soybean. BC did not enhance the protein and oil content of intercropped maize, especially in the first year, but increased maize starch content. BC was found to have no positive impact on soybean protein, but it unexpectedly increased soybean oil content. The TOPSIS method revealed that the comprehensive assessment value first increased and then declined with increasing BC and N application. BC improved the performance of maize-soybean intercropping system in terms of yield, WUE, NRE, and quality while N fertilizer input was reduced. The highest grain yield in two years was achieved for BC of 17.1-23.0 t ha(-1) and N of 156-213 kg ha(-1) in 2021, and 12.0-18.8 t ha(-1) BC and 161-202 kg ha(-1) N in 2022.

However, this increasing crop yield costs large amounts of water used by intercropped plants. In addition, intercropping usually requires higher inputs that induce greenhouse gas emissions. Actually, it is unknown whether intercropping can be effective in water-limited arid areas. Here, we measured crop yield, water consumption, soil respiration, and carbon emissions of wheat-maize intercropping under different tillage and crop residue management options. A field experiment was conducted at Wuwei in northwest China in 2011 and 2012. Our results show that wheat-maize intercropping increased grain yield by 61 % in 2011 and 63 % in 2012 compared with the average yield of monoculture crops. The intercropping under reduced tillage with stubble mulching yielded 15.9 t ha(-1) in 2011 and 15.5 t ha(-1) in 2012, an increase of 7.8 % in 2011 and 8.1 % in 2012, compared to conventional tillage. Wheat-maize intercropping had carbon emission of 2,400 kg C ha(-1) during the growing season, about 7 % less than monoculture maize, of 2,580 kg C ha(-1). Reduced tillage decreased C emission over conventional tillage by 6.7 % for the intercropping, 5.9 % for monoculture maize, and 7.1 % for monoculture wheat. Compared to monoculture maize, wheat-maize intercropping used more water but emitted 3.4 kg C per hectare per millimeter of water used, which was 23 % lower than monoculture maize. Overall, our findings show that maize-wheat intercropping with reduced tillage coupled with stubble mulching can be used to increase grain production while effectively lower carbon emissions in arid areas.","2015","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","reduced tillage, stubble mulching","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

However, the water productivity, tradeoffs, and water-use portfolios of farm diversification in agroforestry combination with tree and/or crop monocultures are still missing, especially in arid water shortage regions. Based on portfolio theory and farmer perception, this study integrates experimental data, meteorological parameters, farmers questionnaire, and yields and prices to assess water use efficiencies, economic return-risk tradeoffs, and portfolio optimizations of diversification farm systems in Moyu oasis of Northwest China. Results show that all the planting layouts of agroforestry systems provide a better economic income than the combination in mixing agroforestry and monocultures in water-use tradeoffs using Sharp ratio. Moreover, allocating part farm area to the nut/fruit trees can increase economic water-use return compared to more crop cultivations, providing a good complement to farm income. The Sharpe ratios of the walnut/wheat, walnut/maize, and walnut/alfalfa intercropping for 23.70%, 15.71%, and 60.60% give the highest economic water-use return compared to the other planting layouts. Nevertheless, according to the minimum risk portfolio and risk-averse farmers' preference, the combination of the walnut/wheat, walnut/maize, and walnut/alfalfa intercropping and monocultures of jujube and apricot (the ratios of 32.01%, 27.63%, 8.11%, 9.81 and 22.45%) is recommended to use for planting layout in the study area.

For this end, two field trials at two sites were carried out with maize (Zea mays L.) on Oxisols under no-till systems in Southern Brazil. For both experiments, a randomized complete block design, with three replications in a split-plot arrangement, was used. The main plots consisted of four urea-N rates at sowing (0, 20, 40, and 60 kg N ha(-1)) and subplots included four urea-N rates in top dressing (0, 80, 160, and 240 kg N ha(-1)). Based on the results, a novel model for prescription of N rate in top dressing for maize was defined. The increases in maize yields with the N rates estimated by the model (16% to 39%) were similar to that obtained with the N rates used for maximum economic yield (15% to 42%). The estimated N rate by the model provided an economic return 36.5% and 7.0% higher than the N rate for maximum yield, and only 6.6% and 2.0% lower than the N rate for maximum economic yield, at sites 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the economic return obtained using the model was closer to that reached with the N rate for maximum economic yield than that for maximum yield. Therefore, the developed model, combining spectral reflectance and agronomic efficiency, exhibited great potential to improve the maize N fertilization efficiency.","2020","JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION","Brazil","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","organic fertilizer, improved varieties","Rejected-Full Text Screening","Yes","Included"

The spatial distribution of the roots, soil moisture, and fertility are affected by tillage practices. The combination of high soil density and the presence of a soil plow pan typically impede the growth of maize (Zea mays L.). We investigated the spatial distribution coordination of the root system, soil moisture, and N status in response to different soil tillage treatments (NT: no-tillage, RT: rotary-tillage, SS: subsoiling) and the subsequent impact on maize yield, and identify yield-increasing mechanisms and optimal soil tillage management practices. Field experiments were conducted on the Huang-Huai-Hai plain in China during 2011 and 2012. The SS and RT treatments significantly reduced soil bulk density in the top 0-20 cm layer of the soil profile, while SS significantly decreased soil bulk density in the 20-30 cm layer. Soil moisture in the 20-50 cm profile layer was significantly higher for the SS treatment compared to the RT and NT treatment. In the 0-20 cm topsoil layer, the NT treatment had higher soil moisture than the SS and RT treatments. Root length density of the SS treatment was significantly greater than density of the RT and NT treatments, as soil depth increased. Soil moisture was reduced in the soil profile where root concentration was high. SS had greater soil moisture depletion and a more concentration root system than RT and NT in deep soil. Our results suggest that the SS treatment improved the spatial distribution of root density, soil moisture and N states, thereby promoting the absorption of soil moisture and reducing N leaching via the root system in the 20-50 cm layer of the profile. Within the context of the SS treatment, a root architecture densely distributed deep into the soil profile, played a pivotal role in plants' ability to access nutrients and water. An optimal combination of deeper deployment of roots and resource (water and N) availability was realized where the soil was prone to leaching. The correlation between the depletion of resources and distribution of patchy roots endorsed the SS tillage practice. It resulted in significantly greater post-silking biomass and grain yield compared to the RT and NT treatments, for summer maize on the Huang-Huai-Hai plain.","2015","PLOS ONE","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","no-tillage, rotary-tillage, subsoiling","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

However, the effects of different fertilization depths on the growth, yield, and nitrogen utilization in summer maize are unclear. In order to determine whether modifying the fertilization depth could improve the yield and nitrogen utilization effi-ciency (NUE) in summer maize, we conducted field experiments for two consecutive years (2019-2020) in a semi-humid and drought-prone area of Northwest China. We systematically analyzed the effects of fertilization depths on the soil mineral nitrogen (NO3--N and NH4+-N) concentration, crop growth, yield, and NUE in summer maize. Five fertilizer placement depths comprising 0 cm (FD0), 5 cm (FD5), 15 cm (FD15), 25 cm (FD25), and 35 cm (FD35) were tested. The results showed that compared with other fertilization depths, FD15 improved the content and distribution of nitrogen in the soil, thus promoting root growth and development and nitrogen absorption (6.5-38.0%). Meanwhile, FD15 increased nitrogen content, chlorophyll content (SPAD value), and photosynthetic rate in the summer maize leaves, thus promoting the accumulation and distribution of dry matter. Similarly, FD15 increased the grain number per ear and 100-grain weight. Therefore, compared with the other deep fertilization treatments, FD15 increased the summer maize grain yield (13.9-98.9%) and NUE (7.1-44.3%). These results clearly demonstrate that in the semi-humid and drought-prone area of Northwest China, a fertil-ization depth of 15 cm was conducive to rain-fed summer maize growth, and it improved the grain yield and NUE.

These factors create a feedback loop, which affects ecosystems and particularly ecosystem services, for example plant-insect interactions, and by consequence agricultural productivity. We studied effects of GEC at a local level, using a traditional coffee production area in greater Nairobi, Kenya. We chose coffee, the most valuable agricultural commodity worldwide, as it generates income for 100 million people, mainly in the developing world. Using the coffee berry borer, the most serious biotic threat to global coffee production, we show how environmental changes and different production systems (shaded and sun-grown coffee) can affect the crop. We combined detailed entomological assessments with historic climate records (from 1929-2011), and spatial and demographic data, to assess GEC's impact on coffee at a local scale. Additionally, we tested the utility of an adaptation strategy that is simple and easy to implement. Our results show that while interactions between CC and migration/urbanization, with its resultant landscape modifications, create a feedback loop whereby agroecosystems such as coffee are adversely affected, bio-diverse shaded coffee proved far more resilient and productive than coffee grown in monoculture, and was significantly less harmed by its insect pest. Thus, a relatively simple strategy such as shading coffee can tremendously improve resilience of agro-ecosystems, providing small-scale farmers in Africa with an easily implemented tool to safeguard their livelihoods in a changing climate.","2013","PLOS ONE","Kenya","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","agroforestry, crop rotation, biological pest control","Rejected-Full Text Screening","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, target_crop_livestock"

Nonetheless, increasing water scarcity is also threatening the sustainability of rice-wheat cropping system. Therefore, farmers are compelled to cultivate alternative crops, like maize for water saving and higher economic returns. However, limited is known for integrated management of nitrogen (N) in wheat and maize crops. This study investigated the impact of integrated N management on productivity and profitability of wheat-maize cropping system. Methods: The study was conducted at Agriculture Research Farm of Bahauddin Zakariya University, Mulan, Pakistan. Wheat and maize crops were cultivated with recommended N dose using inorganic and organic sources, either alone or in combination with biofertilizer, while no N application was regarded as control. Data relating to root biomass yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) were collected. Results: Organic fertilizer alone and in combination with inorganic fertilizer and biofertilizer significantly improved root biomass and SOC. Improved SOC and crop root system resulted in better productivity of wheat-maize cropping system. Sole inorganic fertilizer application improved crop yield; however, had almost no effect on SOC. Integrated N management strategy (50% organic and inorganic fertilizer in combination with biofertilizer), improved crop yield (7168, 6405 kg/ha), net benefit (US$ 779, 961) and SOC (2.75%, 1.59%) for maize and wheat crops, respectively. Conclusion: Integrated N management strategy using different N sources seemed a viable and economically sound alternative of conventional N management, which would further strengthen the sustainability of wheat-maize cropping system.

This study assessed the impact of six different agroecological fertilization protocols (AFPs) on hibiscus productivity planted in an alley cropping system with Calliandra houstoniana trees. The AFPs were based on the combination of three local plant amendments: C. houstoniana mulch, Mucuna pruiriens var. utilis green manure and hibiscus stover, and a commercial bio-fertilizer (Azospirillum + Rhizophagus). Simultaneously, the performance of C. houstoniana trees was assessed. The AFPs were applied in the alley cropping system and evaluated from 2016 to 2018.

The plastic-film mulch increased SOC mineralization, indicated by the stimulated decomposition of buried maize straw, and a 4-5% reduction in the concentration of light-fraction SOC (<1.8 g cm(-3)), but the total SOC concentration and stock in the 0-0.15 m soil layer did not change relative to no mulch after six years of continuous cropping. Plastic-film mulch did not affect the total non-cellulosic sugar content; however, it significantly increased the contribution of microbial-synthesized sugars to the total non-cellulosic sugars, indicating an intensified microbial action on the SOC pool compared to no mulch. Straw incorporation increased the root biomass, light and total SOC concentrations and non-cellulosic sugars, and changed the non-cellulosic sugar composition. We conclude that the increase in soil temperature and moisture by use of plastic-film mulch enhances productivity, but importantly maintains the SOC level in temperature- and rainfall-limited semiarid regions by balancing the increased SOC mineralization with increased root-derived C input.

One-time application of slow release fertilizer (SF) has been widely used to reduce yield gap with potential maize yield and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). A 2-year field experiment (2018-2019) was conducted to evaluate the effects of SF rates from 0 to 405 kg N ha(-1) (named F0, SF225, SF270, SF315, SF360, and SF405) and 405 kg N ha(-1) of common fertilizer (CF405) on the grain yield, biomass and N accumulation, enzymatic activities related with carbon-nitrogen metabolism, NUE and economic analysis. Results indicated that the highest grain yields, NUEs and economic returns were achieved at SF360 in both varieties. The enzymatic activities related with carbon-nitrogen metabolism, preand post-silking accumulation of biomass and N increased with increasing SF rate, and they were the highest at SF360 and SF405. The grain yield at SF360 had no significant difference with that at SF405. However, the N partial factor productivity, N agronomic efficiency and N recovery efficiency at SF360 were 9.8, 6.6 and 8.9% higher than that at SF405. The results also indicated that the average grain yields, NUE and economic benefit at SF405 were 5.2, 12.3 and 18.1% higher than that at CF405. In conclusion, decreasing N rate from 405 kg ha(-1) (CF) to 360 kg ha(-1) (SF) could effectively reduce the yield gap between realized and potential maize yields. The N decreased by 11.1%, but the yield, NUE and economic benefit increased by 3.2, 22.2 and 17.5%, which created a simple, efficient and business-friendly system for spring maize production in Jiangsu Province, China.","2021","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","slow release fertilizer","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

However, information on production risks and profitability of fertiliser use on smallholder farms is generally lacking because most of the early studies have focused on mean yields and yield components on research stations. This study applied rigorous analyses to determine conditions under which (1) production risks are low; (2) the recommended nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser rates achieve a yield target of >= 3 t ha(-1) believed to be a necessary condition to kick start a smallholder-led `green revolution' in Africa and (3) N and P fertiliser use is profitable on smallholder farms in East Africa. Analysis of data from 464 on-farm trials in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda revealed significant variations in production risks and nutrient use efficiency with season and soil type. On most sites, except in Uganda, production risks were lower with the recommended N and P fertilisers than the control during both the short and long rains. Production risks were three to four times higher with N and P fertiliser relative to the control on Lixisols and Ferralsols, but such risks were much lower on Nitisols, Leptosols, Vertisols, Plinthosols and Cambisols. The probability of exceeding grain yields of 3 t ha(-1) with the recommended N and P rates was over 0.60 on Nitisols and Leptosols, but less than 0.20 on Lixisols and Plinthosols. The agronomic use efficiencies of N (AEN), P (AEP) and value cost ratios (VCR) were highest on Cambisols and lowest on Plinthosols. The VCR increased linearly with increase in AEN (R-2 = 0.92) and AEP (R-2 = 0.87) and less so with increase in grain yields (R-2 = 0.47-0.60). Net present values indicated profitably of N and P fertiliser over the long term in only 30% of the site by season combinations in Uganda compared with 69% in Kenya, 81% in Rwanda and 84% in Tanzania. Patterns of N use efficiencies were different from P use efficiencies across soil types. Therefore, we recommend that N and P fertilisers should be appropriately targeted to soils where applied nutrients are used efficiently by maize crops.","2022","EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE","Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","inorganic fertilizer optimization","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

To ameliorate the associated issues such as plastic-film residues and additional labor during the ``seedling release'' in spring maize production, we have developed a plastic-film-side seeding (PSS) technology with the supporting machinery. In the semi-arid regions of Northwest China, a 7-year trial demonstrated that PSS increased plant number per hectare by 6 547 and maize yield by 1 686 kg ha-1 compared with the traditional method of seeding under plastic-film mulch (PM). Two-year experiments were conducted in two semi-arid regions to further understand the effects of PSS on three important aspects of production: (i) the moisture and temperature of soil, (ii) maize development, yield output, and water use efficiency (WUE), and (iii) the revenue and plastic-film residuals in comparison with that of flat planting (CK) and PM. Continuous monitoring of the soil status demonstrated that, compared with CK, the PSS treatment significantly increased the temperature and moisture of the 0-20 cm soil in the seeding row at the early stage of maize development, and it also promoted grain yield (at 884-1 089 kg ha-1) and WUE, achieving a similar effect as the PM treatment. Economically, the labor inputs of PSS were equal to CK, whereas the PM cost an additional 960 CNY ha-1 in labor for releasing the seedlings from below the film. Overall, the PSS system increased profits by 5.83% (547 CNY ha-1 yr-1) and 8.16% (748 CNY ha-1 yr-1) compared with CK and PM, respectively. Environmentally, PSS achieved a residual film recovery rate of nearly 100% and eliminated 96 to 130 kg ha-1 of residual plastic-film in PM in 3-5 years of maize production. Collectively, these results show that PSS is an eco-friendly technique for improving yield stability and incomes for the sustainable production of maize in semi-arid regions.","2023","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","plastic-film mulch, water harvesting, improved varieties","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

A strategy to deal with these problems is to develop diversified productive schemes, such as agroforestry systems (SAF). This study determined the cover dynamics and biomass of weeds in an SAF composed of forage trees and maize during two cropping cycles (CC). Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Moringa oleifera, associated with maize, and a plot of maize monocrop were evaluated with a complete random block design with three replications. Weed cover, biomass, diversity and density were measured at the beginning, middle and end of the two CC. The weeds were collected in squares delimited by 50 x 50 cm frames distributed randomly in each experimental unit, separated by species and dried. With this data, an ANOVA was performed, and when significance was detected, the Tukey test (p <= 0.05) was used. At the beginning of the first CC, the SAF Guazuma + maize had lower weed cover (41 %), while Moringa + maize was higher at the middle and end (71 and 49 %). At the beginning of the second CC, the Guazuma + maize SAF had less weed cover, and Guazuma + maize and Leucaena + maize were lower (54 and 48 %). In both CC, weed biomass in the SAF was almost half that of monocropped maize. At the end of both CC, the Guazuma + maize system had less weed diversity than the maize monocrop. At the beginning and end of the two CC, weed density was greater in the monocrop. Eighteen botanical families were identified and, of these, 21 % were leguminous. The suppression of weeds in the SAF was 23 to 36 %.

However, little is known about how straw application alters soil respiration by influencing soil biochemical properties in this region. This is the first study to evaluate the role of soil enzyme activity and glomalin content in the response of soil respiration to straw application at different growth stages in a wheat-maize rotation system. Field experiment was conducted in a wheat-maize rotation system and it contained two treatments: straw residue removal (CK) and straw residues application (SR). Soil respiration, moisture, and temperature were measured using LI-8100 at different growth stages during wheat and maize (2013-2015) growing seasons. From 2013 to 2014, soil sample (0-20 cm) was collected at different growth stages during wheat and maize growing seasons and transported to the laboratory. Glomalin content and soil enzyme activity were analyzed by using Bradford and enzyme-labeled meter method, respectively. In addition, we determined soil chemical properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total N content (TN), ammonium N (NH4 (+)-N), and nitrate N (NO3 (-)-N) concentrations. SR significantly increased soil respiration and this promotion effect became more significant after 4-year straw application. Soil respiration exhibited significant seasonal variation and was significantly increased by soil temperature with Q (10) ranging from 1.73 to 2.14 for CK and from 1.51 to 2.28 for SR. Both soil temperature and moisture accounted for 70-72% of the seasonal variation in soil respiration. SR significantly increased easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein during 2013-2014 wheat growing season except jointing stage. In addition, positive and significant effect of SR on activities of beta-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase was observed at initial and vigorous growth stages. Straw application significantly increased TN, but did not significantly influence SOC, NH4 (+)-N, and NO3 (-)-N concentrations. Our study demonstrated that straw application increased soil respiration by stimulating soil enzyme activities and improving easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein. Straw application is recommended as an agricultural management in the North China Plain because of its role in improving biochemical properties. To improve soil biochemical parameters with a relative low soil respiration rate, further information is necessary about the optimum amount of straw application.","2018","JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS","North China Plain","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","straw residue application","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, target_crop_livestock"

Our results show that the gross margin of the intercropping system exceeded that of the double cropping system by more than 50% in 2012. Labor use in the intercropping system was more than three times that in double cropping. The lower returns per labor hour in intercropping, however, exceeded the average off-farm wage in the region by a significant margin.

This has over time led to a decrease in crop yield, among them also maize. This decrease is also experienced in the sub-humid and semi-arid locations of Kenya. Among the commonly used soil and water management practices in SSA are Conservation Agriculture (CA) and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). Crop response to these management practices is influenced by the existence of soil fertility gradients which are common among smallholder farmers. This paper presents results from a study done in the sub-humid and semi-arid location of Kenya, focusing on the effects of CA- and/or ISFM-based practices on maize yield. Trials were set out on farms within the two locations using a one farm one replicate randomized design. In each farm, CA-based treatment, no tillage with residue retention (NTR), ISFM-based treatment, conventional tillage with use of manure (CTM), a combination of CA + ISFM, no tillage with residue retention and use of manure (NTRM) and a control, (C) were laid down on fields representing high and low fertility soils. The trials started in the long rains of 2017 (LR2017) running for four seasons i.e., LR2017, short rains 2017 (SR2017), long rains 2018 (LR2018) and short rains 2018 (SR2018). Soil water content (SWC) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were also monitored and evaluated. In either high or low fertility fields, maize grain yield was significantly different between the control and both NTR, CTM and NTRM with no significant differences between NTR, CTM and NTRM. Maize grain yield increase compared to the control was highest under ISFM in the low fertility fields in both locations and all seasons. For example, during the last season, SR2018, NTR, CTM and NTRM significantly increased maize grain yield by 136 %, 297 %, and 208 %, respectively, compared to the control, in the low fertility fields of subhumid Kibugu. In the semi-arid Machang'a, the increase by NTR, CTM and NTRM, respectively, in the low fertility fields was 146 %, 379 % and 183 % for SR2018. This was linked to the tendency of ISFM to improve crop yield in the short run. For both locations, SWC and NUE were highest under NTR. In the sub-humid Kibugu, during SR2018, at the grain filling stage, 78 days after sowing, SWC under NTR, CTM and NTRM was higher by 16 %, 9 % and 20 %, respectively, compared to the control. Also at 78 days after sowing, in the semi-arid Machang'a, SWC was 18 %, 7 % and 15 % significantly higher under NTR, CTM and NTRM, respectively, compared to the control. The higher SWC observed under NTR and NTRM was related to no tillage with residue retention while under CTM it was related to improved soil organic matter through manure addition. NUE, on the other hand, was 26 % and 23 % in Kibugu and Machang'a, respectively, and lowest under the combined practice (NTRM), i.e., 19 % and 15 % in Kibugu and Machang'a, respectively. The high NUE under CA was attributed to the placement of urea in the planting holes while maintaining residue on the soil surface. The low NUE under NTRM was linked to fertilizer N immobilization. Lastly, from the biomass yield, our study showed that monocrop maize under NTR requires a kick-starting by an ISFM-based practice in the low fertility fields of the semi-arid region.","2020","FIELD CROPS RESEARCH","Kenya","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","no tillage, residue retention, manure, urea placement","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

In the present work, the morphological quality of sweet corn ears was assessed in response to four levels of soil moisture tension indicating irrigation start (-5, -30, -55, and -80 kPa) and three levels of phosphate fertilization (60, 80 and 100 kg ha(-1)) in carstic soils in the south-east of Mexico. A factorial experimental design with three replicates was used. The following variables were determined: fresh weight (SCFWh), dry weight (SCDWh), diameter (SCDh), and length (SCLh) of sweet corn ears, all without husk, as well as number of kernels (NKxE), number of unfilled kernels (NUK), number of rows (NRxE), and dry kernel weight per ear (DKW). Yield of fresh (YFSCh) and dry (YDSCh) sweet corn ears, both without husk, and the harvest index (HI) were also determined. HI did not show significant statistical differences among irrigation or fertilization treatments. Regarding the other variables, the effect of the more humid treatments (-5 and -30 kPa) and the effect of the higher phosphorus doses (80 and 100 kg ha(-1)) were statistically equal (P <= 0.01) with the lowest NUK and the highest values of all other variables: therefore, irrigation start at soil moisture tension of -30 kPa and phosphate fertilization application of 80 kg ha(-1) are recommended. At this level of soil moisture, the mean values over the three fertilization levels and all the replicates, obtained for SCFWh SCDh SCLh and NKxE were 198.5g. 4.39 cm, 26.72 cm and 467 grains, respectively. According to the regression models, moisture tensions from -11.8 to -24.0 kPa, and phosphate fertilization doses from 87.7 to 102.2 kg ha(-1) minimize NUK and maximize the values of the rest of the variables. The highest irrigation water use efficiency was found in the moisture tension treatment of -30 kPa with an increase of 27 kg ha(-1) ears for each millimeter of applied irrigation water.

We present a methodology based on the use of the visible and near infrared images from a Sequoia camera together with weather and actual yield data (Y-a), to model actual evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass production (BIO), retrieving water productivity based on both BIO (WPBIO) and actual yield (WPYa). Different nitrogen (N) fertilizing cover levels (0-250 kg ha(-1)) and sources (nitrate - Nt and urea - Ur) were analyzed for supporting precision agriculture, aiming a fertilizing recommendation for good corn yield while reducing water use and N leaching problems. According to our statistical analyzes, there were no significant difference on ET values for the N treatments inside the analyzed phenological stages (PS) due to the proportional partition into soil evaporation and transpiration from seeding to harvest stages, but as BIO values is related to transpiration which in turn varied with PS until a certain limit, they affected WP till N cover fertilizing level of 150 kg ha(-1) for both Nt and Ur N sources. Regarding the growing season (GS) WP components, no significant differences were verified between Nt and Ur N sources, being the average values for ET, BIO, and Y-a, of 394 mm GS(-1), 17.3 t GS(-1), and 8.8 t GS(-1), which yielded mean WPBIO andWP(Ya) of 4.4 kg m(-3) and 2.2 kg m(-3), corresponding to a harvest index (HI) around 0.50 considering all N cover fertilizing treatments. The most important finding of the current research is that the SAFER algorithm can be applied to estimate ET with high resolution aerial cameras without the thermal bands, and together with modelled BIO or Y-a data, WP assessments can be carried out following the principles of precision agriculture. The slightly lower WP values for Ur N source and the advantage of its lower both price and N leaching problems, Ur applications at 150 kg ha(-1) is recommended to save money while avoiding N leaching to the ground water, when compared with Nt source.

This study assessed the water requirement to produce a CC with enough biomass for weed suppression benefits during cash crop growth at two locations in New Mexico. Three winter CC species, barley, Austrian winter pea and mustard, grown singly and in a three-way mix, under three differential irrigation treatments (one, two or three irrigations after emergence) were evaluated for their weed-suppressive potential. Maize was planted as a cash crop four weeks after winter CC termination. Number of irrigations had no effect on the CC and weed biomass production. All CCs had lower weed density prior to maize planting compared with fallow. Barley and the three-way mix reduced weed density by 56-96% and 68-95%, respectively. All CC treatments had lower weed biomass at the end of critical period for weed control in maize compared with fallow. Weed biomass at maize harvest did not differ between treatments. The maize yield was consistently higher in conventionally managed, weed-free subplots, than in unsprayed weedy subplots, suggesting that CCs did not suppress weeds throughout the maize growing season. Except for barley, CCs did not cause reductions in maize yield compared with fallow.

A two-year (2016/17-2017/18) field experiment in a loamy sand soil was conducted at Nhacoongo Research Station, southern Mozambique. Two tillage systems (conservation (CA) and conventional tillage (CT)), two fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), and seven cropping patterns (four sole crops and three maize-legume intercrops) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with split-split plot arrangement and replicated four times. CA practices resulted in significantly higher soil chemical properties and increased stover and grain yields as compared to CT practices, but fertilization demonstrated insignificant effects on soil chemical properties and significant influences on stover and grain yield of maize and legumes. Cropping patterns induced no significant effect on soil chemical properties and either stover or grain yield. Estimated indices like land equivalent ratio (1.18-2.67) and competitive ratio index (0.01-1.72) confirmed the advantage of intercropping against sole cropping.

Specifically, nine soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm depth and 15-30 cm depth to assess the soil's hydraulic performance. The results showed that the total porosity under PRB (42.1%, 15-30 cm) was significantly improved by 13.5% compared to TT (37.1%, 15-30 cm). The soil organic carbon under PRB (8.65%, 15-30 cm) was increased by 13.82% compared to TT (7.6%, 15-30 cm). Changes in the slope (b) of the soil water retention characteristic curve under the PRB (7.2, 15-30 cm) treatment were indicative of an improvement in the pore size distribution, increased soil water retention, and greater infiltration rates. In addition, positive changes in lateral water infiltration from furrow irrigation were observed under PRB (over 25 mm min(-1) in 45 min). These improved soil physical parameters demonstrated that PRB can offer more possibilities for water conservation in the field. In addition, the application of PRB and the principles of conservation agriculture have potential for the effective of water use efficiency and for improving the quality of soil.","2023","LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","permanent raised beds, no-tillage, traditional tillage","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Insights in the impacts of climate change on maize yields and the potential to mitigate negative impacts by crop management are currently lacking for Zambia. Using five Global Circulation models and the WOFOST crop model, we assessed climate change impacts on maize yields at a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Impacts were assessed for the near future (2035-2066) and far future (2065-2096) in comparison with a reference period (1971-2001). The surface temperature and warm days (above 30 degrees C) are projected to increase strongly in the southern and western regions. Precipitation is expected to decline, except in the northern regions, whereas the number of wet days declines everywhere, shortening the growing season. The risk of crop failure in western and southern regions increases due to dry spells and heat stress, while crops in the northern regions will be threatened by flooding or waterlogging due to heavy precipitation. The simulated decline in the water-limited and water- and nutrient-limited maize yields varied from 15 to 20% in the near future and from 20 to 40% in the far future, mainly due to the expected temperature increases. Optimizing management by adjusting planting dates and maize variety selection can counteract these impacts by 6-29%. The existing gaps between water-limited and nutrient-limited maize yields are substantially larger than the expected yield decline due to climate change. Improved nutrient management is therefore crucial to boost maize production in Zambia.","2021","CLIMATIC CHANGE","Zambia","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","improved varieties, water harvesting","Rejected-Full Text Screening","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

AS 1572 and AG 9030. Experiments were carried out at Santa Maria, RS, Brazil in the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 growing seasons using a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial arrangement to distribute two maize hybrids, inoculated, or not, with Azospirillum brasilense, and five nitrogen doses (0, 60, 120, 240, and 480 kg ha(-1)). Kernel yield, mass, and dimensions, as well as kernel number on the cobs, stalk diameter, plant height, ear insertion height, prolificacy, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and their correlations were measured. Compared to uninoculated plants, higher kernel yield (p < 0.05) was observed for AS 1572 hybrid when inoculated with A. brasilense, with an increase of 0.978 Mg ha(-1) or 10.95%. This effect was primarily due to the higher NUE rate and the increase (p < 0.05) in the number of kernels per cob. The AG 9030 hybrid showed no response to inoculation. A. brasilense inoculation increased the NUE rate of the AS 1572 hybrid in the condition N zero dose at N 60 kg ha(-1) dose. Nitrogen fertilization increased crop productivity, notably by raising kernel mass and other productivity components, but reduced the NUE rate. The maximum technical efficiency obtained for the AS 1572 hybrid was of 10.705 Mg ha(-1) with a N dose of 342 kg ha(-1), whereas the AG 9030 hybrid produced a maximum grain yield of 10.089 Mg ha(-1) with a dose of 350 kg ha(-1) of N.

Soil microorganism is the controller of soil fertility. Meanwhile, soil microbial communities also respond to different cropping patterns. The mechanisms by which biotic and abiotic factors were affected by different cropping sequences remain unclear in the major grain-producing regions of northeastern China. To evaluate the effects of different cropping sequences under conventional fertilization practices on soil properties, microbial communities, and crop yield, six types of plant cropping systems were performed, including soybean monoculture, wheat-soybean rotation, wheat-maize-soybean rotation, soybean-maize-maize rotation, maize-soybean-soybean rotation and maize monoculture. Our results showed that compared with the single cropping system, soybean and maize crop rotation in different combinations or sequences can increase soil total organic carbon and nutrients, and promote soybean and maize yield, especially using soybean-maize-maize and maize-soybean-soybean planting system. The 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon sequencing showed that different cropping systems had different effects on bacterial and fungal communities. The bacterial and fungal communities of soybean monoculture were less diverse when compared to the other crop rotation planting system. Among the different cropping sequences, the number of observed bacterial species was greater in soybean-maize-maize planting setup and fungal species in maize-soybean-soybean planting setup. Some dominant and functional bacterial and fungal taxa in the rotation soils were observed. Network-based analysis suggests that bacterial phyla Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria while fungal phylum Ascomycota showed a positive correlation with other microbial communities. The phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) result showed the presence of various metabolic pathways. Besides, the soybean-maize-maize significantly increased the proportion of some beneficial microorganisms in the soil and reduced the soil-borne animal and plant pathogens. These results warrant further investigation into the mechanisms driving responses of beneficial microbial communities and their capacity on improving soil fertility during legume cropping. The present study extends our understanding of how different crop rotations effect soil parameters, microbial diversity, and metabolic functions, and reveals the importance of crop rotation sequences.

The experiment followed a completely randomized block design with four treatments (SIMI, S1M2, S2M1, and S2M2) and three replicates for FSS and FNS, respectively. The four treatments resulted from the combination of two levels of lateral spacing (S1 for 1.0 m and S2 for 0.5 m) and two film-covering modes (full mulching, M1; partial mulching, M2). In each treatment, the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU) was used to evaluate the uniformities of soil water (CUw) and nitrate (CUn) distribution in the vertical soil piofile. The results showed that the narrower lateral spacing and full mulching enhanced CUn and relative chlorophyll content of leaf, compared with the wider lateral spacing and partial mulching. However, lateral spacing and mulching methods imposed no significant effect on CUw. The correlation between CUw and CUn was not significant under mulched drip irrigation system. In soils without a subsurface sand layer, crop yield may be greater with a higher CUn, in root zone. Full film-covering significantly enhanced CUn and then increased crop yields and WUE in FNS, however the combined effects of lateral spacing and mulching methods on grain yield were not significantly different. Thus, taking into account crop yields, WUE, and cost of drip laterals, the combination of wider irrigation lateral spacing and partial mulching was recommended for the FSS soil, while the combination of wider irrigation lateral spacing and full mulching for the FNS soil.

Simultaneous intercropping of common bean with maize can influence growth, development, and dry matter partitioning of grain of common bean. The main objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the dynamics of growth and development of the different vegetative organs, and (ii) determine the efficiency in dry matter partitioning to yield components of two common bean lines grown under monoculture compared with two simultaneous intercropping patterns (pattern 1, pattern 2) with maize and managed with two types of fertilizer application. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications was used in a nested trifactorial arrangement in split-plot scheme. The field experiment was conducted in two seasons under conditions of acid soils and high temperatures in the western Amazon region of Colombia. Simultaneous intercropping patterns 1 and 2 had a negative effect on growth dynamics of maize compared to maize monoculture. But the two bean lines when associated with maize showed no significant differences on growth dynamics under both types of fertilizer application. Under both intercropping patterns, the maize cobs were larger, a condition that increased the number of grains, but with smaller size of grains compared to monoculture. In the case of two bean lines, the growth and development responses were different: under monoculture the number of pods and seeds per plant was higher while the number of grains per pod increased under intercropping patterns. Among the two bean lines, 100-seed weight was significantly higher in BFS 10 compared to ALB 121. At the grain yield level of common bean, the simultaneous intercropping pattern increased 516 kg ha(-1) and 993 kg ha(-1) more than that obtained in monoculture (4936 kg ha(-1)) with inorganic and organic fertilizer, respectively.

Crop intensification and diversification by introducing legumes as intercrops could help alleviate these challenges. With the presence of diverse crops and cropping systems, particularly in hilly topographies, a range of intercrop options is required. We compared 10 intercrop combinations to native sole cropping systems in the mid-hills of Nepal for two cropping seasons (2015-2017) to identify the most productive and economic intercrop combinations for smallholder terrace agriculture. In the spring-summer season (i.e., mid-March to mid-July), cowpea (var. Makaibodi and Suryabodi) and bean were intercropped with maize in 1:1 rows, whereas soybean, blackgram, and horsegram were broadcast with millet (30:70 ratios) during the rainy-autumn season (i.e., mid-July to mid-November). Pea and lentil were used as pre-winter/winter intercrops (i.e., mid-November to mid-March) in mustard (30:70 ratios), while wheat was planted with pea. Ginger was planted with maize in 1:1 rows during the spring-summer season in which the maize rows were replaced by soybean and lentil during the rainy-autumn and pre-winter/winter season, respectively. Plots were analyzed for yields of individual crops as well as other agronomic indicators including land equivalent ratio (LER), total land output (TLO), harvest index (HI), and potential economic return. Maize + cowpea var. Makaibodi appeared to be the most productive and economic intercrop combination for the spring-summer season (LER - 1.58 and TLO - 4.26 t ha(-1), 21% higher than the maize sole crop with an increase in potential economic return by 67%) whereas millet + soybean appeared to be the best combination for the rainy-autumn season (LER - 1.40 and TLO - 2.21 t ha(-1), 26% higher than the millet sole crop with a 288% increase in potential income). For the pre-winter/winter season, wheat + pea and mustard + pea combinations appeared to be productive (wheat + pea: LER - 1.31 and TLO - 2.90 t ha(-1) i.e., 16% higher than sole wheat with a 54% increase in potential income; mustard + pea: LER - 1.36 and TLO - 2.14 t ha(-1) i.e., 30% higher than sole mustard with a 15% increase in potential income). The year round intercrop system (i.e., ginger + maize-soybean) displayed a LER value of 2.45 with increased TLO (21.8 t ha (-1) i.e., 2% higher compared to sole ginger) which increased potential economic return by 6%. We conclude that legume intercropping was a robust option across seasons and locations confirming that it could be a promising ecological practice for intensification of cereal-based sole cropping systems on smallholder terraces. Also, it is important to note that soybean and pea provided higher potential net income to farmers as sole crops compared to when they were grown with millet and wheat as intercrops, respectively. It is important that we promote these options to smallholder farmers and disseminate the advantages of legume integration on land productivity, soil fertility management, and income.","2018","FIELD CROPS RESEARCH","Nepal","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping, soybean, blackgram, cowpea, pea, lentil","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Greater soil N2O emissions were observed in the first 45 days after the cover crop residue management in all crop rotations, varying from -20.2 +/- 1.9 to 163.9 +/- 24.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Legume-based crop rotations had the largest cumulative emissions in this period, which were directly related to the quantity of N (r(2) = 0.60, p = 0.13)and inversely related to the lignin:N ratio(r(2) = 0.89,p = 0.01) of the cover crop residues. After this period, the mean fluxes were smaller and were closely related to the total soil N stocks (r(2) = 0.96, p = 0.002).

Evrard) Crins promotes differences in the agronomic performance of maize and if split top-dressing N fertilization in the previous crop (common bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L.]) promotes increase in maize agronomic performance. The experiment was conducted during two agricultural years in southeastern Brazil, with treatments arranged as a split-plot fitted in a randomized block design, with four replications. Main plot was cropping systems (two systems - maize sole and maize intercropped with U. ruziziensis) while subplots comprised 10 combinations of split top-dressed N applications, totaling 90 kg ha(-1), applied to the previously cultivated common bean crop. Regardless of the agricultural year, intercropping with U. ruziziensis sown simultaneously with maize reduced maize yield by 12% on average. Intercropping maize and U. ruziziensis increased soil coverage from an average of 64-100% over maize as an only crop. The agronomic performance of maize grown in sole crop or intercropped with U. ruziziensis was not influenced by the effect of top-dressing N fertilization applied in common bean under no-tillage as previous crop. Intercropping maize with U. ruziziensis is a viable option for producers seeking improved soil coverage or grazing opportunities, however, caution is needed since maize yields may be reduced.","2021","AGRONOMY JOURNAL","Brazil","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping, organic fertilizer","Extracted","Yes","Included"

The current study was carried out during the successive summers of 2020 and 2021 in Northern Egypt. The main objective was to evaluate the effect of three N schedules (NS1, NS2, NS3), when three different maize-cowpea intercropping patterns (IP1, IP2, IP3) were applied, on the grain yield of maize, forage yield and quality of forage cowpea. In addition, yield gain and land use efficiency were evaluated using the land equivalent ratio (LER) and dry matter equivalent ratio (DMER) indices. Results revealed that the intercropping patterns that provided wider spacings for the component crops and reduced the competition between them, mainly IP3, resulted in the best performances for the two crops. This was clear for maize ear and grain yields, 100-grain weight and harvest index, in addition to cowpea fresh and dry forage yields, crude protein and non-fiber carbohydrates of the three cuts. Regarding the applied N schedules, NS1 which included the application of a N starter dose with sowing proved to be the most efficient schedule that led to the best performance for both crops. Maize produced 9.07 t ha(-1) grain yield under IP3 and NS1. In addition, the application of IP3 resulted in the highest significant cowpea dry forage yield (DFY), with the highest crude protein (CP) content. The DFY of cuts 1, 2, and 3 amounted to 1.27, 0.45, and 0.24 t ha(-1), while the CP content for the three respective cuts reached 159.49, 157.96, and 148.91 g kg(-1). Nonetheless, NS1 produced a reasonable amount of DFY with high CP content. It is recommended to follow the third proposed intercropping pattern (IP3) and to include a nitrogen starter dose (NS1) in the fertilization scheme to ensure highest productivity from the intercropped maize and forage cowpea.","2022","AGRONOMY-BASEL","Egypt","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping, N schedules, dose management","Rejected-after extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Better understanding of weed management and costs in maize inter-cropped with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.) during transition to conservation agricultural systems is needed. Changes in weed population and maize growth were assessed for a period of three years at Bungoma where crops are grown twice per year and at Trans-Nzoia where crops are grown once per year. Treatments included three tillage practices: minimum (MT), no-till (NT) and conventional (CT) applied to three cropping systems: continuous maize/bean intercropping (TYPICAL), maize/bean intercropping with relayed mucuna after bean harvest (RELAY) and maize, bean and mucuna planted in a strip intercropping arrangement (STRIP). Herbicides were used in NT, shallow hand hoeing and herbicides were used in MT and deep hoeing with no herbicides were used in CT. Weed and maize performance in the maize phase of each cropping system were assessed at both locations and costs of weed control were estimated at Manor House only. Weed density of grass and forb species declined significantly under MT and NT at Manor House and of grass species only at Mabanga. The greatest declines of more than 50% were observed as early as within one year of the transition to MT and NT in STRIP and TYPICAL cropping systems at Manor House. Transitioning to conservation based systems resulted in a decline of four out of five most dominant weed species. At the same time, no negative impact of MT or NT on maize growth was observed. Corresponding costs of weed management were reduced by $148.40 ha(-1) in MT and $149.60 ha(-1) in NT compared with CT. In conclusion, farmers can benefit from effective and less expensive weed management alternatives early in the process of transitioning to reduced tillage operations.","2015","PLOS ONE","Sub-Saharan Africa","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","intercropping, cover crops, no-till, minimum tillage, herbicide use, weed management","Rejected-Full Text Screening","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

Rainfall interception, transpiration, runoff and soil water content were monitored during 3 years. Runoff was lower in AFS than MC (5.4 and 8.4% of total rainfall, respectively) and a higher water infiltration was observed under AFS. Still, the higher combined rainfall interception + transpiration of coffee and shade trees in AFS resulted in a lower drainage than in MC. No coffee water stress was recorded either in AFS or MC as relative extractable soil water remained above 20% during the dry seasons. Time course of soil water content showed enhanced access to soil water between 100 and 200 cm depth in AFS. This suggests complementarity for soil water between coffee and shade trees. The model HYDRUS 1D predicted that drainage at 200 cm depth accounted for a large fraction of annual rainfall (68% for MC and 62% for AFS). Climatic scenario simulations showed (1) a potential competition for water between coffee and shade trees when the dry season was extended by 4-6 weeks compared to actual, and (2) a severe reduction in annual drainage, but without competition for water when rainfall was reduced down to 40% of the actual.

The objective of this study was to measure the performance of two intercropped systems in terms of total above-ground biomass production and maize (Zea mays) grain yield: pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and Brachiaria (Brachiaria ruziziensis) sown as cover crops in established maize under a no-tillage management. The cover crops were sown at two different dates and a comparison was made with the three crops sown as a sole crop at the early sowing date. The experiment was conducted during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 growing seasons. Maize grain yield was not reduced by the presence of the relay cover crops in comparison with maize as the sole crop, even when the cover crop was sown soon after maize emergence. In contrast, the production of above-ground biomass by the cover crop was significantly lower when grown with maize than it was when grown as a sole crop. In the intercropped systems, when sown early, the cover crop produced higher total biomass than when sown late. Total above-ground biomass production of maize intercropped with a cover crop was much higher than that of any of the crops sown alone: the total biomass (average of the two growing seasons) produced by maize and pigeon pea was more than double that of maize grown alone. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of maize grain yield and biomass production was higher than one whatever the intercropped system used. It was particularly high when maize was intercropped with early sown pigeon pea; grain yield LER and biomass LER reaching, respectively, 1.72 and 1.73 in 2007-2008 and 2.02 and 2.03 in 2008-2009. These high LER values provide evidence for the complementary and the high efficiency of use of available resources by the intercropped plants and thus the advantage of such systems to produce both maize grain and cover crop forage under the conditions of our study.

The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) started a biological control (BC) program in 1991 to control stem borers in subsistence agriculture in Africa with emphasis on classical BC of C. partellus. The project released the braconid larval parasitoid Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in 1993 in coastal Kenya, where it got established and spread to other regions. This study assesses the economic impact of the introduced parasitoid. Temporal data on percentage parasitism by the introduced parasitoid and on stem borer density were collected between 1995 and 2004. Socio-economic data was collected through administration of questionnaires to 300 farmers. Economic impact of the project was calculated as the value of the yield loss abated by the parasitoid based on a model of expected stem borer density and parasitism level. Average annual parasitism increased linearly from the time of introduction to reach 20% parasitism by 2004. The net reduction in total stem borer density over the last 10 years was 33.7%, thus abating 47.3% of yield loss. The region will accumulate a net present value of US $ 183 million in economic benefits in 20 years since release of the parasitoid.

In this study, a field fertilization experiment was conducted in a light sandy loam soil from the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China to determine the variation in soil available P, P composition and phosphatase activities with 23 years of continuous application of maize straw or cattle manure in combination with chemical fertilizers at the depth of 0-20 cm, with special attention paid to their relationships. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with three replications for each treatment, including the unfertilized control (CK), chemical nitrogen (N) with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) (NPK), NPK plus maize straw (NPKS), and NPK plus cattle manure (NPKM). Results indicated that all fertilization treatments significantly increased soil P concentration and crop yields. Among the fertilization treatments, NPKM treatment showed the significantly highest total P and available P concentrations, while no significant difference in either wheat or maize yield between NPK, NPKS and NPKM treatments was found. Compared to the application of chemical NPK fertilizers alone, the NPKS treatment significantly increased soil organic P, pyrophosphate and orthophosphate concentrations, as well as soil phosphatase activities. The increase in orthophosphate concentration under the NPKS treatment may be associated with the hydrolysis of organic P and pyrophosphate catalyzed by acid phosphomonoesterase (AcP), phosphodiesterase (PD) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (IPP), which was conducive to keeping soil available P concentration under NPKS treatment at an appropriate level that could not only satisfy crop P demand but also have no negative impacts on the environment. However, the increase of orthophosphate and available P concentrations under NPKM treatment may be primarily related to the manure P inputs, and although NPKM treatment significantly increased soil inorganic P concentration in comparison to other fertilization treatments, it also increased the risk of P leaching. Overall, from the perspective of P nutrient management, our results suggest that NPKS treatment might be an effective long-term fertilization practice in the light sandy loam soil of Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China.

The objective of this study was to decompose maize yield gaps under different nitrogen (N) application rates and soil quality conditions across irrigated and rainfed cropping systems in China. A comprehensive database consisting of 5228 on-farm trials located in three major maize production regions of China was used for this purpose. The on-farm trials contained detailed information for four different treatments: fertilizer omission (control), optimal N rate (optimal N), 50% of optimal N rate (low N) and 150% of optimal N rate (high N). These were combined with biophysical and yield potential data from the Global Yield Gap Atlas (http://yieldgap.org). An analytical framework integrating sto-chastic frontier analysis and principles of production ecology was applied to decompose the overall maize yield gap into components of efficiency (and respective management and soil quality effects, Yg-M and Yg-S), resource (Yg-R), and technology Yg (Yg-T). The potential yield (Yp) of irrigated maize averaged 14.5 Mg/ha in Northeast China (NE) and 11.9 Mg/ha for North China Plain (NCP), and the water-limited potential yield (Yw) of rainfed maize averaged 12.0 Mg/ha in NE and 10.5 Mg/ha in Southwest China (SW), respectively. Maize yield gaps were highly variable across N treatments and cropping systems and ranged between 27-56% of Yp or Yw. Larger absolute yield gaps were observed in irrigated cropping systems in NE (4.8-8.1 Mg/ha) than in NCP (3.8-6.1 Mg/ ha) and in rainfed cropping systems in NE (3.6-6.7 Mg/ha) and SW (2.8-5.9 Mg/ha). The components of the yield gap differed in size across cropping systems and N treatments. Yg-T was fairly small and consistent across N treatments ranging between 7.0% and 12.0% of Yp for irrigated maize and only ca. 2.0% of Yw for rainfed maize in NE. Yg-R was strongly associated with the N treatment explaining between 16.0-26.0% of Yp (or Yw) for control and low N treatments and being close to negligible for the optimal and high N treatments. Yg-M due to inefficient crop management accounted for 6.0-14.0% of Yp (or Yw) across cropping systems and N treatments, which is equivalent to 0.7-1.8 Mg/ha. The Yg-S explained the largest proportion of the total yield gap, especially in trials with low and medium soil quality levels, accounting for 11.0-24.0% of Yp or Yw (1.3-3.1 Mg/ha). The Yg-S was linked to partly manageable soil properties, such as low soil organic matter contents and low available P and/or K. This study is one of the first to incorporate the effects of soil quality in yield gap analysis and provides a basis to target management practices that can improve soil quality and N use efficiency while nar-rowing maize yield gaps in China.","2021","FIELD CROPS RESEARCH","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","optimal N rate application, low N rate application, high N rate application","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

A study was conducted on-farm to determine the influence of three landscape positions on N dynamics in maize (Zea mays L.)-based agroforestry systems. The agroforestry systems were relay fallow using Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr or Tephrosia vogelii (Hook F.), simultaneous fallow using Gliricidia sepium(Jacq.) Walp., and maize without trees as a control. Sesbania was superior to other systems in the bottom slope, producing the highest tree biomass (1,861 kg ha(-1)), whereas, gliricidia gave the highest tree biomass production in the mid-slope (2,147 kg ha(-1)) and upper slope (1,690 kg ha-1). Preseason inorganic N, maize flag leaf N concentration, maize total N uptake and maize yields followed a similar trend to tree biomass production with tree-based cropping systems exhibiting higher productivity (P < 0.05) than the cropping systems without trees. Nitrogen leaching from gliricidia agroforestry systems was lower than in the other agroforestry systems across all landscape positions as evidenced by 17% lower amounts (P < 0.05) of inorganic N adsorbed to ionic exchange resin membranes at 60 cm soil depth most likely due to the permanent root system of gliricidia. The difference between delta N-15 values of the trees and the soil did not change between landscape positions suggesting that if the leguminous trees fixed atmospheric N-2, the proportion of total N uptake was identical at all locations. We concluded that landscape positions have a significant effect on tree performance with sesbania remarkably adapted to the bottom slope, gliricidia to the mid-slopes and tephrosia fairing similar in both the bottom slope and mid-slopes.","2006","NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS","Malawi","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","agroforestry","Extracted","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC, target_crop_livestock"

The effect of nutrient availability on the growth, production, root development, water relations and water use efficiency (WUE) by the intercrop maize/cowpea was investigated in 2 contrasting years (dry and wet) in the semiarid region of Brazil. The crops were grown on a strongly acidic, sandy soil with three treatments: (i) application of NPK fertilizers plus lime (NPK + lime), (ii) application of NPK fertilizers (NPK) and (ii) control (Contr.) in low and high input regimes. The soil water balance was calculated with the crop model EPICSEAR. Application of fertilizers and lime increased biomass production and grain yield of the intercrop up to 400% and 550%, respectively, and maize suffered more from the effects of low nutrient availability and soil acidity than cowpea. The root development of both crops was strongly improved by the application of NPK and lime and cowpea developed a deeper root system which enabled this crop to keep a higher transpiration rate in the dry year. As a consequence of the shallow root system, maize was prone to water stresses caused by the dry spells and its harvest index was reduced when dry spells occurred during flowering and grain filling. Fertilizers and lime application reduced deep percolation and soil evaporation while increasing the productive transpiration flow. WUE were improved through the application of nutrients and lime and maize showed higher WUE than cowpea. The omission of lime showed only minor effects on the evaporation and transpiration WUE. The model probably over-emphasizes the effects of high At saturation on the root growth and water uptake and consequently underestimated the transpiration rate of the crops. Nevertheless, the gross WUE was reduced up to 58% when lime was omitted and NPK applied at high inputs. A balanced fertilization in combination with lime improves the root development of a maize/cowpea intercrop in acid Acrisols of the semiarid NE of Brazil. The improved root development allows a better use of soil water reserves and increases the WUE of the system.

Conservation agriculture (CA) is specifically intended to control erosion. The aim of the present study is to analyse the effectiveness of CA measures to reduce the erosion in maize cultivation (Zea mays L.) on andosols in the mountains of southern Guatemala. Resolving this question is crucial to the development of sustainable soil policies appropriate to the conditions prevailing in this region. The study was conducted over a three-year period, from 2017 to 2019, on three experimental plots managed under conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT). The general-to-specific (GETS) method, based on reduction theory, was used to generate explanatory models of the erosion-affected surface. The study was carried out at two scales, first, with the complete database, and second, the database was segmented according to the agricultural management systems. The results showed different rates of eroded soil surface between the three management systems: 73.2% under CT, 41.3% under RT and 20.4% under NT. Analysis of the complete database (n = 36) showed that the litter cover (ryl.p = -0.86, p < 0.001) and the soil disturbance (ryp.l = 0.57, p < 0.001) were, in that order, the factors with the greatest explanatory power of the eroded surface. The segmented analysis (n = 12) showed that the management system adopted had a decisive influence on the ground cover (litter and weed cover) and, therefore, on the soil erosion. Under CT, the eroded surface was only correlated with the weed cover (ryw.l = -0.68, p < 0.05), under NT only with the litter cover (ryl.w = -0.89, p < 0.001) and under RT the erosion did not correlate with either of the vegetal layers. Three conclusions are derived from this study. First, litter layer was the key explanatory factor of erosion. Second, this factor is highly influenced by the agricultural management system. The proportion and distribution of the litter layer in each management situation were key to explaine the different soil erosion rates between the three management systems. And finally, it is proposed for the area of this study the soil management under NT with a dense and well distributed litter cover.","15/12/2021",NA,"Guatemala","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","reduced tillage, no-tillage, crop residue management","Extracted","Yes","Included"

Crop rotation and conservation tillage appears to serve as an effective strategy to optimize water resources distribution and utilization. From 2007-2019, a 12-yr in-situ experiment consisting of three cropping systems (winter wheat continuous cropping, WW; winter wheat-spring maize rotation, WM; spring maize continuous cropping, MM) and two tillage methods (conservation tillage, subsoiling, ST; conventional tillage, plowing, CT) were conducted in a semi-arid region, and grain yield, economic profit, water use, precipitation storage and loss, soil water balance were analyzed to explore the mechanism and potential of crop rotation and conservation tillage regulating soil water balance and increasing farmland productivity. Our results show that compared to WW, WM and MM significantly enhanced grain yield by 4358 and 8791 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle, respectively. And ST increased grain yield after 3 cycles with 979 kg ha-1. WM and MM with ST significantly reduced precipitation loss (78 and 135 mm) during the fallow period, and increased WUE (6.5 and 10.8 kg ha-1 mm-1), compared to WW-CT. With the passage of time, soil water storage of WW and MM showed a decreasing trend in 100-200 and 0-100 cm layers compared to pre-experiment, with the rate of 18.1 and 13.6 mm per cycle. And ST could ease the downward trend, relative to CT. However, the WM-ST maintained soil water balance by regulating water use and precipitation storage, compared to the two continuous cropping systems. Additionally, correlation analysis showed that evapotranspiration was positive to soil water balance and we should consider crop water use when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit. Overall, the WM-ST achieved better soil water sustainability, on the basis of sacrificing grain yield partly (4646 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle) compared to MM-ST, which perhaps more eco-friendly and sustainable agricultural technique to replace WW-CT in the Loess Plateau of China.","2021","AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","crop rotation, reduced tillage","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"

A 3-yr maize field experiment (2008-2010) was conducted to evaluate the response of grain yield, aboveground biomass, plant N concentration, N uptake, and NUEs to fertilizer N rates from 0 to 280 kg N ha(-1) at three different rain-fed Haplic Phaeozem soils (FAO classification) in Northeast China, When N application rate increased from 70 to 280 kg N ha(-1) across all site-years, N recovery efficiency, N agronomic efficiency, N internal efficiency and N partial factor productivity decreased from 763 to 9.0%, 25.3 to 0.1 kg kg(-1), 70.7 to 40.8 kg kg(-1), and 145.6 to 22.8 kg kg(-1), respectively. Differences observed among the years and experimental sites were primarily caused by variability in rainfall and soil characteristics, The maximal grain yield of 11.0 Mg ha(-1) was achieved at an N rate of 210 kg N ha(-1) with normal rainfall. Nitrogen application beyond the optimal N rate did not consistently increase grain yield, and caused a decrease in NUEs. The range of optimal N rate for maize grain yield fell between 140 and 210 kg N ha(-1) at the three sites from 2008 to 2010 in Northeast China based on the best fitted models (quadratic, linear plus plateau, and quadratic plus plateau). The results provide guidelines for selecting N application rates to optimize both maize yield and NUEs in Northeast China.","2015","AGRONOMY JOURNAL","China","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","inorganic fertilizer, improved varieties","Rejected-Other locations","No","Excluded - Issues: is_LAC_CAC"
